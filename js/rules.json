After Robots have been set up on the Playing\nField, Drive Teams are required to stand Completely Inside the Alliance Station at the location (Station one or\nStation two) specified by the Qualification Match schedule.\na. During the Qualification Matches, the Blue Alliance Robots are set up on the Playing Field first\nunless the Red Alliance waives their right to set up on the Playing Field second.\nb. During the Elimination Matches, the lower seeded (e.g. 3rd seed is lower than 2nd seed) Alliance\nRobots are set up on the Playing Field first, unless the higher seeded Alliance waives their right\nto set up on the Playing Field second. Alliance color doesn’t change the seeding of a Team\nduring the Elimination Matches. If the 4th seed defeats the 1st seed in the Semi-Finals, they will\nstill have to place their Robot on the field first in the Finals because their seeding will be lower\nthan the 2nd or 3rd seed.\nc. Teams may implicitly waive their right to place their Robots on the Playing Field last by placing\ntheir Robots on the Playing Field before or in conjunction with the opposing Alliance. There is no\nneed to notify the referees; Teams waive their right by the act of placing their Robots on the\nPlaying Field.\nd. Teams that unnecessarily delay the beginning of a Match and/or field reset will incur a Minor\nPenalty for each offense."
